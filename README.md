# PCM modelling for DMT

If this works, the script will be able to produce power-time curve for any set of design parameters and material properties. It will also calculate the definite integral of each power-time curve to determine how much energy would have been transferred within a given time frame (eg: how many Joules transferred to engine in first 5 mins of discharging PCM).
